                    <h4>What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</h4>

                        <li>We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge
                            of Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the
                            rodent's evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form
                            also capable of generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this
                            species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers should be able to
                            answer.</li>

                    <h4>What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</h4>
                    <ul class="answer">
                        <li>Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off
                            with, but progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of the
                            stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any
                            Pokemon game, you've reached the point where you're presented with the most effective Poke
                            Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button mashing at all is required.</li>
